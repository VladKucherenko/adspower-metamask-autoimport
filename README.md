# Adspower metamask auto import

this script will import pre-made metamasks into your ready-made profiles in adspower. the script was written in haste, for me the main thing was that everything worked. after import it adds optimism, bsc and arbitrum networks to the wallet.

1. export adspower ids from your profiles.
2. add these ids to the id_users.txt file
3. add seed phrases from pre-created wallets to the seeds.txt file
4. change the password variable in the main.py file
5. run the main.py file

## Important
do not forget to log into your adspower in advance, the script works through it.

download libraries: pip install selenium, requests, pyperclip, termcolor
